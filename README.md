**Proposal for filteredMap Array Method**

We propose the addition of a new array method called `filteredMap()` to JavaScript. This method aims to combine the functionalities of `filter()` and `map()`, allowing developers to filter elements based on a condition and then transform the filtered elements using a map function. This new method provides a more efficient way to perform both operations in a single iteration, enhancing code readability and performance.

### Method Signature:

```javascript
Array.prototype.filteredMap = function(filterFunction, mapFunction [, thisArg]) {
    // Implementation goes here
};
```

### Parameters:

- **filterFunction (element, index, array):** A function to test each element of the array. Return `true` to keep the element, `false` otherwise. This function works similarly to the `filter()` method.

- **mapFunction (element, index, array):** A function to transform the elements of the array. It takes each filtered element as input and returns the transformed element. This function is akin to the `map()` method.

- **thisArg** A value to use as `this` when executing `filterFunction` and `mapFunction`.

### Usage Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const filteredMappedNumbers = numbers.filteredMap(
    element => element % 2 === 0, // Filter: Keep even numbers
    element => element * 2         // Map: Double the filtered numbers
);

console.log(filteredMappedNumbers);
// Output: [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
```

### Proposed Behavior:

1. The `filteredMap()` method iterates over each element in the array.

2. For each element, it applies the `filterFunction()`. If the function returns `true`, the element is kept; otherwise, it is skipped.

3. If an element passes the filter, the method applies the `mapFunction()` to transform the element.

4. The transformed elements are collected into a new array, which is returned as the result of the `filteredMap()` operation.

### Benefits:

1. **Simplified Code:** Developers can achieve both filtering and mapping operations in a single line of code, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

2. **Improved Performance:** By combining the filtering and mapping operations, unnecessary iterations through the array are avoided, improving performance, especially for large datasets.

3. **Code Readability:** The method promotes a more declarative and functional programming style, enhancing the readability of the code.

### Compatibility:

This proposed method aligns with the existing array methods in JavaScript and adheres to the principles of functional programming. It maintains consistency and coherence within the language's array manipulation capabilities.

We believe that the addition of the `filteredMap()` method will be a valuable enhancement to JavaScript, providing developers with a more concise and efficient way to handle common array transformations.

The decision to introduce a new method instead of incorporating an optional map function into the existing `filter` method was made to preserve the `filter` method's signature, avoiding potential backward compatibility concerns.
